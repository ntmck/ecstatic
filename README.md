# ECStatic Game Engine
ECStatic is a game engine designed for small games.

ECStatic will not support any front-end or rendering, but is strictly an entity-component system that handles the back-end of small games.

The goal of the project is to have a light-weight, efficient, and easy to use game engine useful for quickly prototyping internal game logic for game designers.

ECStatic is developed using Test-Driven Development to the best of my ability.
